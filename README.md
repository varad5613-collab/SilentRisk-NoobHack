SilentRisk – Early Health Risk Detection (Hackathon Project)

SilentRisk is a web-based prototype built for NoobHack that focuses on early health risk indication, not diagnosis.
SilentRisk is an AI-based health surveillance system which is aimed at identifying early health risks by studying the daily smartphone signals including use, activity, and behavioral records. The system is designed to detect open health issues in the initial stage and warn users in order to act promptly.

This is a proof-of-concept, not a medical product.

🚀 What Problem Are We Solving?

Most health apps react after something goes wrong.
SilentRisk focuses on early signals like:

- Stress patterns

- Energy levels

- Daily mood trends

- Sleep behavior trends

These aren’t diseases. They’re risk indicators.
Ignoring them is how people screw themselves long term.

🎯 Objectives

- Identify possible health threats at an early stage based on daily smartphone information.

- Intelligent prediction of health risk using AI/ML models.

- Issue early notices and fundamental warnings.

- Market preventative health and awareness.


🧠 How SilentRisk Works (Flow)

1. Intro / Disclaimer

    - Clear consent (no diagnosis, no medical claims)

2. Daily Check-in

    - Short questionnaire (2–3 minutes max)

3. Context-Based Analysis

    - Trends over time, not one-day nonsense

4. Risk Output

    - Low / Medium / High risk score

    - Simple explanation (human-readable, not ML jargon)

5. Trends & History

    - Visual graphs to show deterioration or improvement


🛠 Tech Stack

Frontend : 

- TypeScript

- Vite

- Tailwind CSS

Backend / Services : 

- Supabase (Auth + Database)

- ML (Planned / Integrated)

- Risk scoring logic (probability-based, not diagnosis)

Models are treated as advisory, not authoritative

⚠️ Disclaimer (Read This or Don’t Use It)

- SilentRisk does NOT diagnose diseases

- It provides risk indications only

- Data shown is for awareness and prevention

- Always consult professionals for real medical decisions

- If you think this replaces a doctor, you’re an mistaken.

🛡️ Ethical Commitment 

- SilentRisk is built with a strong focus on user trust, privacy, and responsible use of technology.  
- All data handling prioritizes user consent and transparency, and the system never makes automated medical decisions.

👥 Team

Built as a hackathon project with distributed responsibilities:

- Frontend & product flow

- ML & data handling

- Research & documentation

- Leadership focused on shipping, not talking.

📌 Status

- Core frontend: ✅ Done
 
- Risk flow logic: ✅ Implemented

- Backend integration: 🚧 In progress

- Deployment: 🚧 Optional (hackathon dependent)

🏁 Final Note

This repo is not perfect.
But it works, it has a clear idea, and it’s miles better than fake “AI healthcare” bullshit with no logic.
